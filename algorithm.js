/*
You're working with a small bookstore's inventory system. 
The store has two arrays of data: one for books in stock and one for customer orders. 
Each book has a title, price, and quantity. Each order has a customer name and the book title they want.
Write a function that takes these two arrays and a book title as parameters.

The function should perform the following checks:

* The book title must be in our existing catalog of inventory
* There must be enough quantity of a book we sell in order to fulfill an order
* If there's enough quantity, check if there are any pending orders for this book
* If there are pending orders, reduce the quantity of the existing inventory for each pending order
* If there is still quantity available for the current order being placed, fulfill the order
* Return an appropriate message for each scenario (can/cannot be fulfilled)

Note: Define the algorithm with comments, and then implement each step with code.
